# Budget-Tracker

## Description:
- This application was created for the person who is always on the go. Sometimes in life we just don't have any internet access. With all of our banking info accessible with just a touch, we've become dependent on the internet to help us with our finances. With the Budget-Tracker, you'll be able to track your debits and credits even offline. Once you get back online, those transactions will be uploaded and reflected.
